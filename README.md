# JacktheRipper
A choice-based puzzle game where you play as Jack the Ripper... but he's actually a good guy?! Based around real historical events, travel back to Victorian England, evading the Scotland Yard and helping the women you "murder". That is, until a copycat killer begins to do real damage to the city. Silently help the police catch the real killer!
